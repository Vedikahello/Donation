# Donation Website
      
There are a lot of NGOs worldwide working for the betterment in various areas. But unfortunately, people aren’t really aware of various such organizations that are doing a great job for the upliftment of the needy people. The goal of this website is to make it easier for the donors to donate as well as organisations to receive funds for their causes.
      Mainly I have used HTML and CSS for frontend coding and PHP language for backend coding.

Project stages
1. The frontend is done where the activities and the different platforms for donation are visible.
2. When the particular donation platform is selected, there is collective information about different causes accepting donations as well as short info on the trustable organizations has been provided. So there buttons are provided that’ll lead the donar to the donation page of the respective trustable organisation.
3. Website will be published on 000WebHost and After making the registration the user’s data is partly being uploaded to the MySQL Cloud
